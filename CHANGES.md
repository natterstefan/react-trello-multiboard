# React-Trello-Multiboard Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here. The format is based
on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased][1]

### Changed

* **Breaking**: `config.js` can now contain multiple `lists` patterns, each list
  will be available in the `<ListTabs \/>` component and can later be used to
  select a specific list. All filters work as expected and as before (also with
  deeplinking for the list patterns)
  * _Note_: even though semver would suggest adding releasing a major release, I
    decided to stick to 0.x.y still until further notice here.

### Added

* `<ListTabs \/>` added

## 2018/06/09 [0.1.1][5]

* Bugfix TrelloCard `isHidden` calculation

## 2018/06/09 [0.1.0][4]

### Added

* [connected-react-router](https://github.com/supasate/connected-react-router)
  added to make history actions and current location available to all components
  in the redux store
* Deeplinkg feature for preferred members: You now get a shareable link when you
  click on a member to filter his cards.

### Changed

* <EstimationCard /> is visible only after it was toggled in the <MainApp />
* <BoardsList /> displays it's estimations already in the title
* upgraded all packages to latest version, including major releases
* use [@natterstefan/eslint-config-ns](https://github.com/natterstefan/eslint-config-ns)
  for eslint, stylelint and prettier

## 2018/05/25 [0.0.2][3]

### Added

* fallback for missing `avatarHash` implemented (use member's `initials`) added
* `sideEffects` option for webpack's treeshaking feature added, `.babelrc` modified
  (`"modules": false`) and prod.config.js (webpack config) updated as well. Read more about
  treeshaking [here](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/),
